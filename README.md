Init

This first project, init, will give the opportunity to discover system and network basic commands, many of the services used on a server machine, as well as a few ideas of scripts that can be useful for SysAdmins on a daily basis.

You must use terminal commands only to solve all the exercices in this subject.
There are three types of questions in this project. You can identify the type of answer expected thanks to a color code:
In blue : a command
In green : a command output
In red : a deduction, written in your own words
